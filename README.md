The requirement for a Huntington Fellowship entails: 

a list of the specific Huntington materials to be consulted (no more than 350 words)

"Please list the Huntington collections you will consult for your project. Please include collection and/or book titles, as well as call numbers and finding aid links when available. If you hit the word limit (350), please list call numbers with shortened titles, and use permanent links from the Huntington catalog."

Step 1. Download csl file. The logic is 1) If there is short title, use short title. If no short title, use full title + 2) Call number of museum object / rare book + 3) catalogue URL.

Step 2.  Install my edited csl style with Zotero.
Save the style with a “.csl” file extension (you can generally do this by simply typing ”.csl” after the name of your file). 
Then, go to the Cite pane in the Zotero preferences. 
Click on the “+” sign below the list of installed styles. 
In the file selection dialogue that opens, navigate to the .csl file you just downloaded and open it. 
This will install my new style into the Zotero data directory.

Zotero may ask, ""...\huntington-library zotero style.csl" is not a valid CSL 1.0.2 style file, and may not work properly with Zotero.Are you sure you want to continue? Click Yes. (It does work properly.)

Step 3. Select all Huntington Library art works, rare books, manuscript etc that you want to view during your visit in Zotero. Right click > generate bibliography from item > Scroll down in "citation style" to select "huntington library". 
Output mode: select 'bibliography'.
Output method: select 'copy to clip board'.
