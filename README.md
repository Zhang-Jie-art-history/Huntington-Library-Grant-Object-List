Step 1. Download csl file. The logic is 1) If there is short title, use short title. If no short title, use full title + 2) Call number of museum object / rare book + 3) catalogue URL.

Step 2.  Install my edited csl style with Zotero.
Save the style with a “.csl” file extension (you can generally do this by simply typing ”.csl” after the name of your file). 
Then, go to the Cite pane in the Zotero preferences. 
Click on the “+” sign below the list of installed styles. 
In the file selection dialogue that opens, navigate to the .csl file you just downloaded and open it. 
This will install my new style into the Zotero data directory.

Step 3. Select all Huntington Library art works, rare books, manuscript etc that you want to view during your visit. in Zotero. Right click > generate bibliography from item > Scroll down in "citation style" to select "huntington library". 
Output mode: select 'bibliography'.
Output method: select 'copy to clip board'.
